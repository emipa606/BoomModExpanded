- This is a fork of https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1504182014]BoomMod by Jaxe
- The main difference is that this version works on all pawns that explode on death, for example the BoomBat from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963681588]Vanilla Animals Expanded â€” Australia
- Requested by Malminas
- Added options for selecting exploding conditions
- Works well with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2324221340]Predators Hunt Boom Critters by velcroboy333

With this mod Boomalopes and Boomrats will only explode on death when the killing blow is a gunshot, burn, another explosion or they are otherwise on fire at the time. Melee weapons, medieval ranged weapons and natural causes do not trigger an explosion.


**This mod can be added or removed from a game at any time without issue.**

*With these animals less likely to explode it may seem logical that they should be hunted by predators. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1511181700]Boom Boom Is Prey by Walking Problem is a mod that does just that and should have no compatibility issues with this one so check that out.*
