Creatures will only explode on death when the killing blow is a gunshot, burn, another explosion or they are otherwise on fire at the time. This is a fork of [BoomMod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1504182014) by Jaxe

The main difference is that this version works on all pawns that explode on death, for example the BoomBat from [Vanilla Animals Expanded — Australia](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963681588)

- Added options for selecting exploding conditions
- Works well with [Predators Hunt Boom Critters](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2324221340) by velcroboy333
