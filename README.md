Creatures will only explode on death when the killing blow is a gunshot, burn, another explosion or they are otherwise on fire at the time. This is a fork of https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1504182014]BoomMod by Jaxe

The main difference is that this version works on all pawns that explode on death, for example the BoomBat from https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963681588]Vanilla Animals Expanded â€” Australia

- Added options for selecting exploding conditions
- Works well with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2324221340]Predators Hunt Boom Critters by velcroboy333
